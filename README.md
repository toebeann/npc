## Description

npc gives you simple tools to implement functions and events in one process or thread, and call or subscribe to them from another.

```js
// my-app/index.js

// a simple function which returns the square of a given number
const npc = await createProcedure((n) => n ** 2).listen("my-app/square")

// create an event publisher for the app
const publisher = await createPublisher().listen("my-app")

// every second, publishes the current UTC timestamp in milliseconds
setInterval(() => {
  publisher.publish("timestamp", Date.now())
}, 1000)
```

```js
// some-other-app/index.js

const squared = await call("my-app/square", 8)
console.log(squared) // outputs 64

// subscribes to the timestamp event being published from the my-app endpoint,
// and logs its data to the console whenever a published event arrives
subscribe("timestamp@my-app", console.log)
```

At present, npc only supports Windows Named Pipes. POSIX named pipe support is not a priority for this package at present, but is certainly something we would like to add in future. Pull requests welcome!

## Installation

### [pnpm](https://pnpm.io "pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient package manager")

```shell
pnpm add @toebean/npc
```

### [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com "Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager")

```shell
yarn add @toebean/npc
```

### [npm](https://npmjs.com "npm is the package manager for Node.js")

```shell
npm i @toebean/npc
```

## Usage

### Functions

Setting up a function to be called from a local process is easy with npc:

```js
import { createProcedure } from "@toebean/npc"

const npc = createProcedure((n) => n ** 2)
await npc.listen("square")
```

And calling it is just as easy:

```js
import { call } from "@toebean/npc"

const x = 8
const xSquared = await call("square", 8)
console.log(xSquared) // outputs 64
console.log(typeof xSquared) // outputs 'number'
```

Please note that it is the callee's responsibility to validate input, and the caller's responsibility to validate the return output. We recommend [Zod](https://zod.dev) for validation.

For convenience, there is an overload which takes a validator function as the second argument. This function can be used to validate and/or transform the incoming input argument before it is passed to the callback.

Here is an example which uses [Zod](https://zod.dev) to validate the input is a number:

```js
import { createProcedure } from "@toebean/npc"
import { z } from "zod"

const npc = await createProcedure((n) => n ** 2, z.number().parse).listen("square")
```

Now, if the client passes an invalid argument, Zod will throw an exception detailing the cause of the exception:

```js
import { inspect } from "util"
import { call } from "@toebean/npc"

try {
  console.log(await call("square", "foo"))
} catch (error) {
  console.error("error:", inspect(error, false, null))
}
// error: {
//   code: -32000,
//   message: 'Internal server error',
//   data: {
//     issues: [
//       {
//         code: 'invalid_type',
//         expected: 'number',
//         received: 'string',
//         path: [],
//         message: 'Expected number, received string'
//       }
//     ],
//     name: 'ZodError'
//   }
// }
```

#### `async`/`await`

Asynchronous functions are fully supported:

```js
await createProcedure(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact")
  if (response.ok) {
    return (await response.json()).fact
  } else {
    throw `${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`
  }
}).listen("getCatFact")
```

#### `notify`: disregarding output for efficiency

If you do not require any output from an npc procedure and do not need to wait for it to complete, consider using the `notify` API instead of `call`:

```js
import { notify } from "@toebean/npc"

await notify("registerData", { foo: "bar", bar: 123 })
```

The above call to `notify` will resolve as soon as the input argument `{ foo: "bar" }` has been transmitted across the named pipe without waiting for a response. If the npc procedure at the other end of the pipe was implemented with this library, it will also not transmit a response, resulting in more efficient usage of the pipe.

##### Implications of the `notify` API

- The procedure at the other end of the pipe will likely not have completed when `notify` resolves. If you need to perform an action upon its completion, you should instead use the `call` API.
- If an error is thrown at the other end of the pipe, `notify` will neither throw nor output error information. If you need to know whether the call succeeded, you should instead use the `call` API.

#### Argument and return types

Input arguments and return outputs are serialized to JSON using `JSON.stringify` before being transmitted over the named pipe, and deserialized using `JSON.parse` at the other end. This means that types which cannot be (de)serialized using these functions will be transmitted as `undefined`. We generally recommend sticking to [PODs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_data_structure "plain old data objects") and [primitives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) (with the exception of `bigint` and `symbol`, which are not natively compatible with JSON).

npc procedures only support a maximum of one argument for simplicity. If you require multiple arguments you can handle this with [PODs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_data_structure "plain old data objects") (e.g. object literals, property bags) or arrays.

### Events

Publishing data to other processes/threads in an event-driven manner is simple with npc:

```js
import { createPublisher } from "@toebean/npc"

// create an event publisher and listen for connections at the "my-app" endpoint
const publisher = await createPublisher().listen("my-app")

// every second, publish the current UTC timestamp in ms to all connected
// subscribers of the "timestamp" event at the "my-app" endpoint
setInterval(() => {
  publisher.publish("timestamp", Date.now())
}, 1000)
```

And subscribing to the event stream is just as simple:

```js
import { on } from "@toebean/npc"

// subscribes to the "timestamp" event at the "my-app" endpoint, and
// logs its event data to the console whenever it is received
on("timestamp@my-app", (timestamp) => console.log(timestamp))
```

npc provides a convenient API for working with npc-published events:

- [subscribe](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.subscribe) (alias: [on](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.on))

  Subscribes to an event published by an npc publisher.

- [unsubscribe](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.unsubscribe) (alias: [off](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.off))

  Unsubscribes from an event published by an npc publisher.

- [subscribeOnce](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.subscribeOnce) (alias: [once](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.once))

  Registers a one-time subscription to an event published by an npc publisher. The next time the event is published, the subscriber will be unsubscribed and then invoked.

- [unsubscribeAll](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.unsubscribeAll)

  Unsubscribes from all npc publisher events.

- [createObservable](https://toebeann.github.io/npc/stable/?page=Function.createObservable)

  Creates an RxJS observable from an npc publisher event.
